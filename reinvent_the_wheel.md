# Reinvent The Wheel

## How to recognize your anti-pattern:
* Closed system architectures—architectures and software—that are designed for one system at a time without provision for reuse and interoperability.
* unstable architectures
* extended development cycle.

## An example of the Anti-Pttern:
* no communication between projects.
* lack of managment.
* no set development process.

## Why is it harmful:
* Inability to deliver end product to users.
* Cost over exceeding budgets
* Inefficient development process 

## solutions:
* Architecture mining = creates an object oriented architecture that is robust, product-independent, reusable, and extensible 
* Extracting valuable information from past designs for use in object-oriented architectures is called architecture mining
