Swiss Army Knife


A class that is trying to solve all possible thing that might happen or similar to a master class. A class that is focused on doing many things as opposed to one.

OOP perspectives should adhere to the SOLID mnemonic. One of the keys of Object Oriented languages is abstraction. By failing to break up large classes that are solving multiple issues into small classes that are solving one issue, it becomes a headache to work with and harder to maintain and work on.  Solid says that classes should have a single responsibility. It might seem corollary to not just programming an entire program in main.

The fix is to adhere to OOP design. Abstraction is the key component to this program and the most prudent solution.
